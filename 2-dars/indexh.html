    <p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in
        the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic
        nor any passengers, I set myself to attemt the dificult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death
        for me: I had scarelly enough drinking water to last a week.</p>
    <p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousans miles from any human habitation. I was more
        isolated than a shipwreeked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at
        sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:</p>
    <p><i>”IF you please-draw me a sheep!”</i></p>
    <i>”What!”</i>
    <i>”Draw me a sheep!”</i>
    <p>I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I
        saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood ther examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the
        best portaint that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than
        its model.</p>

    <p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painters career when i was six years old,and I
        never learned to draw anything, except boats from the outside and boas from inside.</p>
        <p>Now i started  at this sudden apparation with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment/ Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousant milis from any inhabitat region. And yet my life little man seemed neither to be staing uncertanly among the sands, nor br fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirs or fear. Nothing abiut him gave any suggestion pf a child lost in the middle of the desertm a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p>
        <i>”But-- what are you doing here?”</i>
        <p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of gerat consenquence:</p>
        <i>If you please--draw me a sheep...</i>
        <i>"That does not matter. Draw me a sheep..."</i>
